        Songs, rhyme, rhythm and fun at your local library



Babies and children who love books and have the pleasure of hearing stories and rhymes have a flying start when it comes to learning to read by themselves.

Sessions incorporate a mix of songs, rhymes, rhythm and movement as well as providing the opportunity to share games, novelty books and toys.

Children are never too young to join the library, it is free and lots of fun!
